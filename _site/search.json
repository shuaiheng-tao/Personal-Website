    "text": "In this project, we explore the effects of cardiovascular exercise on memory performance within the virtual landscape of The Islands. Specifically, we are looking to compare how various duration of exercise impact memory and if memory is affected at all. Our interest in exploring this topic relates to our group members’ backgrounds in physical activity and cognitive science. One of our group members heard that running could potentially lead to benefits in the phenomenon known as “runner’s high” so we chose to set up an experiment to explore this idea further.\nHere is the report Report"

    "text": "For this project, Our question of interest would be that, based on the Seda dataset in 2018, what is the relationship between the Unemployment rate and factors such as Median income, Locale, Poverty rate, SNAP rate, and Socioeconomic index? The motivation is to understand the relationship between the Unemployment rate and socioeconomic factors is crucial for analyzing the dynamics of labor markets and identifying key determinants of employment outcomes. By examining the impact of the Median income, Locale, Poverty rate, SNAP rate, and Socioeconomic index on the Unemployment rate, we can gain insights into the complex interplay between these variables and their influence on employment opportunities and economic well-being.\nHere is the pdf for our report: Report"
