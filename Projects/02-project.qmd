In this project, we explore the effects of cardiovascular exercise on memory performance within the virtual landscape of The Islands. Specifically, we are looking to compare how various duration of exercise impact memory and if memory is affected at all. Our interest in exploring this topic relates to our group members' backgrounds in physical activity and cognitive science. One of our group members heard that running could potentially lead to benefits in the phenomenon known as “runner’s high” so we chose to set up an experiment to explore this idea further.
